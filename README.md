## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps Blinkit understand its sales performance better. It provides insights into sales, profit, and quantity across different items, outlets, and demographic and geographic segments. By analyzing these metrics, Blinkit can identify trends, best-performing products, and areas that need improvement.

Since some outlets or product categories may have lower sales or profitability, this dashboard helps pinpoint these areas, allowing Blinkit to optimize its inventory, pricing, and marketing strategies.

Additionally, if certain regions or demographics show lower engagement or order volume, Blinkit can focus on targeted promotions and service enhancements to improve customer satisfaction and overall business performance.
